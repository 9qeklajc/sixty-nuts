# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests that test the complete wallet functionality against real mint and relay infrastructure.

## Overview

The integration tests verify:

- Wallet creation and initialization
- Minting tokens (creating Lightning invoices)
- Sending and redeeming tokens
- Balance checking and proof validation
- Fee calculation and handling
- Multi-mint operations
- Error handling

## Running Integration Tests

### Method 1: Using the Integration Test Runner (Recommended)

The easiest way to run integration tests is using the automated script that manages Docker containers:

```bash
# From the project root
./run_integration_tests.sh
```

This script will:

1. Start fresh Docker containers (mint + relay)
2. Wait for services to be ready
3. Run all integration tests
4. Clean up containers afterward

### Method 2: Manual Docker + pytest

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be ready (check logs)
docker-compose logs -f

# In another terminal, run integration tests
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Clean up
docker-compose down -v
```

### Method 3: Against External Services

You can run tests against existing services by setting the environment variables:

```bash
export RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1
export TEST_MINT_URL=https://testnut.cashu.space
export TEST_RELAY_URL=wss://relay.damus.io

pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

## Test Categories

### Basic Operations (`TestWalletBasicOperations`)

- Wallet creation and initialization
- Balance checking on empty wallet
- Mint quote creation

### Minting (`TestWalletMinting`)

- Asynchronous minting flow
- Invoice generation

### Transactions (`TestWalletTransactions`)

- Send and redeem flow
- Multiple send operations
- End-to-end token transfers

### Proof Management (`TestWalletProofManagement`)

- Proof validation
- Proof consolidation

### Fee Calculation (`TestWalletFeeCalculation`)

- Input fee calculation
- Fee handling with different rates

### Token Parsing (`TestWalletTokenParsing`)

- CashuA (V3) token parsing
- Invalid token handling

### Error Handling (`TestWalletErrorHandling`)

- Insufficient balance errors
- Invalid currency units

## Test Environment

### Docker Services

The integration tests use these Docker services (defined in `compose.yml`):

- **Cashu Mint**: `localhost:3338` - Local mint for testing token operations
- **Nostr Relay**: `localhost:8080` - Local relay for NIP-60 wallet events

### Fresh State

Each test run uses fresh containers with no persistent data, ensuring:

- Clean mint state (no existing tokens)
- Empty relay state (no existing events)
- Isolated test environment

## Test Configuration

Integration tests are controlled by environment variables:

- `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` - Must be set to run integration tests
- Without this variable, integration tests are skipped

This ensures:

- `pytest` alone runs only unit tests
- Integration tests run only when explicitly requested
- CI/CD can control test execution

## Debugging Integration Tests

### View Service Logs

```bash
# View all service logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service
docker-compose logs -f cashu-mint
docker-compose logs -f nostr-relay
```

### Manual Service Testing

```bash
# Test mint directly
curl http://localhost:3338/v1/info

# Test relay (requires WebSocket client)
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080
```

### Running Single Tests

```bash
# Run specific test class
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 pytest tests/integration/test_wallet_complete_flow.py::TestWalletBasicOperations -v

# Run specific test method
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 pytest tests/integration/test_wallet_complete_flow.py::TestWalletBasicOperations::test_wallet_creation_and_initialization -v
```

## Adding New Integration Tests

When adding new integration tests:

1. Add them to the appropriate test class in `test_wallet_complete_flow.py`
2. Use the `wallet` fixture for basic tests
3. Use the `funded_wallet` fixture for tests requiring balance
4. Mark tests with `@pytest.mark.skip()` if they require manual intervention
5. Ensure tests clean up after themselves

Example test:

```python
async def test_new_feature(self, wallet):
    """Test a new wallet feature."""
    # Setup
    initial_balance = await wallet.get_balance()
    
    # Test action
    result = await wallet.new_feature()
    
    # Assertions
    assert result is not None
    
    # Cleanup (if needed)
    # ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting

```bash
# Check Docker daemon
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Check port conflicts
sudo lsof -i :3338
sudo lsof -i :8080

# Force clean state
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -f
```

### Tests Failing

1. Check service health: `docker-compose logs`
2. Verify services are ready: `curl http://localhost:3338/v1/info`
3. Run tests with more verbose output: `pytest -vvv`
4. Check for port conflicts or firewall issues

### Memory/Performance Issues

The Docker containers are lightweight but may consume resources:

```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Limit resources in compose.yml if needed
```

## Notes

- Integration tests may take longer to run (30-60 seconds)
- Tests require network access for Docker image pulls
- Some tests are skipped by default (require manual intervention like paying invoices)
- The test runner automatically handles container lifecycle

## Setup

Set the environment variable to enable integration tests:

```bash
export RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1
```

## Test Files

### test_wallet_complete_flow.py

Tests the complete wallet functionality against real mint and relay infrastructure.

### test_lnurl_requests.py  

Tests LNURL functionality against real services.

### test_mint_methods.py

Tests mint API methods against real mint services.

### test_relay_lookup.py

**NEW**: Comprehensive relay integration tests that test both `relay.py` and `events.py` functionality using public Nostr relays.

#### What it tests

**Basic Relay Operations:**

- Connection establishment and reconnection
- Event fetching with filters and timeouts
- Timeout handling and error recovery

**Event Publishing & Retrieval:**

- Publishing text notes and fetching them back
- Publishing NIP-60 wallet metadata events (kind 17375)
- Publishing delete events (NIP-09)
- End-to-end publish/fetch verification

**Queued Relay Operations:**

- Event queuing system with priorities
- Batch processing and callbacks
- Queue processor lifecycle management
- Pending proofs tracking for token events

**Relay Pool & Manager:**

- Multi-relay pool creation and management
- Relay discovery from kind:10019 events
- Publishing through relay managers
- Connection management and cleanup

**Event Manager Operations:**

- Wallet event creation and verification
- Token event publishing with NIP-60 format conversion
- Spending history events (kind 7376)
- Proof format conversion (hex â†” base64)
- Event counting operations

**Error Handling:**

- Connection timeout handling
- Invalid event rejection
- Graceful failure modes

#### Public Relays Used

- `wss://relay.damus.io` - Primary test relay
- `wss://relay.primal.net` - Secondary relay  
- `wss://relay.nostr.band` - Tertiary relay

#### Key Features

- Uses fresh generated nsec keys for each test run
- Tests against real public relays (no mocking)
- Handles rate limiting gracefully
- Comprehensive coverage of both relay.py and events.py
- Tests both successful operations and error conditions

#### Running

```bash
# Run all relay integration tests
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 python -m pytest tests/integration/test_relay_lookup.py -v

# Run specific test categories
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 python -m pytest tests/integration/test_relay_lookup.py::TestBasicRelayOperations -v
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 python -m pytest tests/integration/test_relay_lookup.py::TestEventPublishing -v

# Run the basic standalone test
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 python tests/integration/test_relay_lookup.py
```

The tests are designed to be robust against public relay quirks including rate limiting, temporary unavailability, and varying relay policies.

### test_wallet_complete_flow.py

Tests complete wallet operations that require both mint and relay services.
